# Input / Output Redirection in Shell

```bash
# input redirection
prog < infile

# pipe input:
# pipes the standard output of otherprog into
# the standard input for prog.
otherprog | prog

# output redirection
# write the standard output to outfile instead
prog > outfile

# puts the standard output of prog into the standard input of anotherprog.
prog | anotherprog
```


```c
getchar() // reads character from stdin
putchar() // puts character to stdout
```

# printf

```c
int printf(char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

- Returns the number of characters printed.

Conversion specification begins with `%` and there maybe, in order:
- **minus sign** (-) : left adjustment of converted argument
- **number** : minimum field width. the converted argument will be printed in a field at least this wide.
- **period** (.) : separates the field width from the precision
- **number** : the precision i.e specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed from a string, or the number of digits after the decimal point of a floating-point value, or the minimum number of digits for an integer.
- **`h` / `l`**  : `h` - print integer as short, `l` - print integer as a long

If the character after the `%` is not a conversion specification, the behavior is undefined.

**Basic printf conversions (after %)**:

`*` - width or precision

```c
// print at most `max` characters from a string `s`
printf("%.*s", max, s);
```


**`printf` uses its first argument to decide how many arguments follow and what**
**their type is**. It will get confused, and you will get wrong answers, if there are not enough arguments of if they are the wrong type.

```c
printf(s); /* FAILS if s contains % */
printf("%s", s); /* SAFE */
```


```c
// holds output in `string` instead of printing to stdout
// `string` must be big enough to receive the result.
int sprintf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...);
```

# scanf

`scanf` stops when it exhausts its format string, or when some input fails to match the control specification.
- The **input arguments**, **each of which must be a pointer**, indicate where the corresponding converted input should be stored.
- It returns as its value the number of successfully matched and assigned input items.

```c
// reads from a string instead of stdin
int sscanf(char *string, char *format, arg1, arg2, ...)
```

The format string usually contains conversion specifications, which are used to control
conversion of input. The format string may contain:
- Blanks or tabs, which are not ignored.
- Ordinary characters (not `%`), which are expected to match the next non-white space character of the input stream.
- Conversion specifications, consisting of the character `%`, an optional assignment suppression character `*`, an optional number specifying a maximum field width, an optional h, l or L indicating the width of the target, and a conversion character.

A conversion specification directs the conversion of the next **input field**.
- `*` - to skip an input field
- input field is defined as a string of non-white space characters; it extends either to the next white space character or until the field width, is specified, is exhausted.

`scanf` will read across boundaries to find its input, since newlines are white space. (White
space characters are blank, tab, newline, carriage return, vertical tab, and formfeed.)

**Basic scanf Conversions (after %)**:

![[./assets/Pasted image 20240817123207.png]]

The conversion characters `d`, `i`, `o`, `u`, and `x` may be preceded by **`h`** to indicate that a pointer to **short** rather than int appears in the argument list, or by **`l`** (letter ell) to indicate that a pointer to **long** appears in the argument list.

Ex:
```c
int day, year;
char monthname[20];

// No `&` is used with monthname, since an array name is a pointer
scanf("%d %s %d", &day, monthname, &year);
```

Common error:
Writing
	`scanf("%d", n);`
instead of
	`scanf("%d", &n);`

This error is not generally detected at compile time.

# Miscellaneous Functions

## String Operations (string.h)

In the following, `s` and `t` are `char *`'s, and `c` and `n` are `int`s.

## Character Class Testing and Conversion (ctype.h)

Several functions from` <ctype.h>` perform character tests and conversions. In the following,`c` is an `int` that can have a value as an `unsigned char` or `EOF`. The function returns `int`:
