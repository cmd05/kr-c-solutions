The standard clarifies the rules on the scope of names; in particular, it requires that there be only one definition of each external object. Initialization is more general: automatic arrays and structures may now be initialized.

- If the return type of a function is omitted, `int` is assumed

# return

- Control also returns to the caller with no value when execution 'falls off the end' of the function by reaching the closing right brace.
- It is not illegal, but probably a sign of trouble, if a function returns a value from one place and no value from another.
- In any case, if a function fails to return a value, its "value" is certain to be garbage.

Ex:
```c
main.c:5:5: warning: 'return' with no value, in function returning non-void
    5 |     return;
      |     ^~~~~~
main.c:3:5: note: declared here
    3 | int fn() {
      |     ^~

// When no return is specified and control ends at right closing brace, 
// no warning is given
```

# Multiple source files
\
Suppose that the three functions are stored in three files called `main.c`, `getline.c`, and `strindex.c`.

The command:
```
cc main.c getline.c strindex.c
```
compiles the three files, placing the resulting object code in files `main.o`, `getline.o`, and `strindex.o`, then loads them all into an executable file called `a.out`.

If there is an error, say in `main.c`, the file can be recompiled by itself and the result loaded with the previous object files, with the command
```
cc main.c getline.o strindex.o
// .c -> source files
// .o -> object files
```

# return types

## implicit declarations
If a name that has not been previously declared occurs in an expression and is followed by a **left parentheses**, it is declared by context to be a function name, the function is assumed to **return an int**, and **nothing is assumed about its arguments**. This is called **implicit declaration**.

Ex:

```c
$ gcc main.c atof.c
main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:17:12: warning: implicit declaration of function 'getline' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   17 |     while (getline(line, MAXLINE) > 0)
      |            ^~~~~~~
main.c:18:33: warning: implicit declaration of function 'atof' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
   18 |         printf("\t%g\n", sum += atof(sum));
      |                                 ^~~~~~~
```

## declaration without specifying parameters

If a function declaration does not include arguments, as in

```c
double atof();
```

that is taken to mean that nothing is to be assumed about the arguments of `atof`; all parameter checking is turned off.

- This special meaning of the empty argument list is intended to permit older C programs to compile with new compilers.

If the function takes arguments, declare them; if it takes no arguments, use `void`.

## return type

The value of the expression in

```
return expression;
```

is converted to the type of the function before the return is taken, *if the types differ*.

# External Variables

external objects: variables or functions (outside function scope)
internal objects: arguments and variables defined inside the function

- External variables are defined outside of any function
- Functions themselves are always external, because C does not allow functions to be defined inside other functions.

External objects follow *external linkage* (all references to them by the same name, even from functions compiled separately, are references to the same thing)

# Scope Rules

The scope of an external variable or a function lasts from the **point at which it is declared** to the end of the file being compiled.

To use it an external variable before it is defined, we must add a `extern` declaration in the place where we want to use it.

declaration - sets properties of variable (primarily its type)
definition - sets aside storage for the variable (i.e creates named memory recognized using the variable's identifier).

Ex: external variables `sp` and `val`
```c
// definitions (sets aside memory) (but not initialized with a value)
// serve as declarations for the rest of that source files
int sp;
double val[MAXVAL];

// only a declaration
extern int sp;
extern double val[];
```

There must be **only one definition of an external variable** among all the files that make up the source program; the files may contain **extern declarations** to access it.

- Array sizes must be specified with the definition, but are optional with an extern declaration.

Ex: Setup **without header files**:

# Header Files

A header file is a file containing C declarations and macro definitions (see Macros) to be shared between several source files.

We have used a single header file in the calculator example, but we could have used multiple.

# Storage Classes

Note: 
 - `static` behaves differently for (automatic) static variables and (global) static variables.
 - Note: In the book K&R C - 2, "external static variables", just refers to the global variables which are declared as `static`, since the static variables in the global scope are only accessible inside the same translation unit. 

- A global variable (i.e **defined** outside a function) has **_external linkage_** by default. Its scope can be extended to files other than containing it by giving a matching `extern` declaration in the other file. i.e it is available **throughout the program**, **by all translation units**
- The scope of a global variable can be restricted to the file containing its declaration by prefixing the declaration with the keyword `static`. Such variables are said to have **_internal linkage_**. i.e static variables (in global scope) have **internal linkage**. i.e available only to the translation unit in which it is defined
