- The character constant '\0' represents the character with value zero, the null character. `'\0'` is often written instead of 0 to emphasize the character nature of some expression, *but the numeric value is just 0*.

A string constant, or string literal, is a sequence of zero or more characters surrounded by
double quotes. Ex:  `"i am a string"`, `"text"` or just `""` (empty string).

Note:
- extern scoped variables can only be initialized with a constant expression in its declaration
- *External and static variables are initialized to zero by default*. 
- *Automatic variables for which is no explicit initializer have undefined (i.e., garbage) values*.
- For an array, the const qualifier says that the elements will not be altered.

The const declaration can also be used with array arguments, to indicate that the function
does not change that array:

```c
int strlen(const char[]);
```

# Operators

Expressions connected by logical operators, `&&` or `||` are evaluated left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the truth or falsehood of the result is known. (**short circuiting**)

**Remember**, postfix unary operators -> prefix unary operators -> binary operators

**Associativity**:

**Operator associativity** is used when two operators of the same precedence appear in an expression. Associativity can be either from **Left to Right or Right to Left.**

- Let us consider an example: `1 == 2 != 3`

Here, operators `==` and `!=` have the same precedence. And, their associativity is from left to right. Hence, `1 == 2` is executed first.

So, The expression above is equivalent to: `(1 == 2) != 3`

Ex:
```
100 / 5 % 2
// left to right
= (100 / 5) % 2
= 20 % 2
= 0
```
---

In the given example, `i < lim - 1` is evaluated as `i < (lim - 1)`.

- The precedence of `&&` is higher than that of `||`, and both are lower than relational and equality operators. Ex:

```c
i < lim-1 && (c=getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF
```

  - since the precedence of != is higher than assignment, parentheses are needed in `(c=getchar()) != '\n'`

Logical expressions and relational expressions evaluate to an integer output, with `1`  if the expression is true and `0` if the expression is false.

Note:
 - `0`, `\0'`, `NULL` all refer to the null-terminator with numeric value 0.

**Remember**:

```c
'0' = 30
'9' = 39

'A' = 65
'Z' = 90

'a' = 97
'z' = 122
```

- Printable characters always have positive values on a machine.

# Type Conversions

Type conversions occur for both arithmetic and relational expressions.

When an operator has operands of different types, they are converted to a common type
according to a small number of rules.
- In general, the only automatic conversions are those that convert a `narrower` operand into a `wider` one without losing information, such as converting an integer into floating point in an expression like `f + i`.

- Expressions that might lose information, like assigning a longer integer type to a shorter, or a floating-point type to an integer, may *draw a warning, but they are not illegal*. (**narrowing**)

```c
// narrow to wide: legal and automatic
// wide to narrow: legal (but warning)
// invalid expression: ex: subscripting array with float - error

// If there are no unsigned
// operands, however, the following informal set of rules will suffice:
// • If either operand is long double, convert the other to long double.
// • Otherwise, if either operand is double, convert the other to double.
// • Otherwise, if either operand is float, convert the other to float.
// • Otherwise, convert char and short to int.
// • Then, if either operand is long, convert the other to long.
```

`ctype.h` gives implementations which are *independent of character set*. ex: `isdigit`, `tolower` etc.

Non-zero value in `if`, `while`, `for` etc. evaluates to "true" condition, while zero evaluates to "false" condition. The same paradigm is used by functions like `isdigit` for their return values.

Read carefully:
- For example, suppose that int is 16 bits and long is 32 bits. Then -1L < 1U, because 1U, which is an unsigned int, is promoted to a signed long. But -1L > 1UL because -1L is promoted to unsigned long and thus appears to be a large positive number.

Conversions take place across assignments; the value of the right side is converted to the type
of the left. Finally the type of the result of the assignment is the type of the LHS.

```c
char c = 0;
if((c = 220) == 220) 
	// RHS of `==` is compared with `value assigned to variable after the
	// assignment`
	// result of assignment `(c = 220)` is `char`
	printf("equal");
else
	printf("%d", (int) c); // 220 overflows to -36

// output: -36
```


- Longer integers are converted to shorter ones or to chars by dropping the excess high-order bits.

```c
int i;
char c;

i = c; // add zero bits to the left
c = i; // value of c is unchanged (extra bits discarded)
```

- In the absence of a function prototype, char and short become int, and float becomes double

# Increment / Decrement

postfix increment / decrement occurs *after the value has been used*.
prefix increment / decrement occurs *before the value has been used*.

# Bitwise Operations

C provides **six** operators for bit manipulation; these may only be *applied to integral operands*,
that is, `char`, `short`, `int`, and `long`, whether signed or unsigned.

```
&    bitwise AND
|    bitwise inclusive OR
^    bitwise exclusive OR
<<   left shift
>>   right shift
~    one's complement (unary)
```

AND (&) - Mask bits (set to bits to zero / extract high bits)
OR (|) - Set bits to ON in specific positions
XOR (^) - Exclusive OR operation (`1` for dissimilar bits, `0` for similar bits)

```
x << 2 // left shift by two bits
	   // equivalent to multiplication by 4 
```

- Left bit shift (bit removed from left side and zero inserted from right i.e shifting to the left) -> multiplication by `2^n`

- Right bit shift (bit removed from right side and zero inserted from left i.e shifting to the right) -> division by `2^n` (and rounds down)

Right shifting an unsigned quantity always fits the vacated bits with zero. Right shifting a signed quantity will fill with bit signs (arithmetic shift) on some machines and with 0-bits (logical shift) on others.\
\
- De Morgan's law for `&`, `|` and `~` are applicable for bitwise operations too.

## Bit Masking

**Bit masking**: means which bits to keep, change, or remove.

When using a bit mask with an AND (`&`) operation,
- the places where the bits of the mask are `1` are extracted from the operand
- while the other bits are set to zero (where the mask bits are `0`)

Ex:
```
     1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0     input
(&)  0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1      mask
------------------------------
     0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0    output
         ^-----^   ^
```


# Assignment Operators

If expr1 and expr2 are expressions, then
	`expr1 op= expr2`
is equivalent to
	`expr1 = (expr1) op (expr2)`

- Note the use of parenthesis around `expr1` and `expr2`

# Conditional Expressions

`(expr1) ? (expr2) : (expr3)`

If expr2 and expr3 are of different types, the type of the result is determined by the conversion rules discussed earlier in this chapter.

Ex:
```c
// f - float
// n - int
(n > 0) ? f : n // type of expression is always float regardless of the 
			    // condition being true or not
```

# Precedence

```c
x = f() + g(); // either f or g maybe evaluated first
printf("%d %d\n", ++n, power(2, n)); // the increment or power function
									 // either maybe evaluated first
									 // depending on the compiler

a[i] = i++; // the subscript value may be the old or new value of `i`
		    // depending on the compiler
```
